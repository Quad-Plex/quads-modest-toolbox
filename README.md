# Quads-Modest-Toolbox for modest-menu

Quads-Modest-Toolbox is a collection of scripts for modest-menu aimed at providing features for freemode gameplay,
rather than to just provide simple ways to earn money. The collection includes a playerlist with modder detection and trolling options,
options for ambient pickups, the ability to spawn/save vehicles with certain mods, a ped changer, player/world options and more.

## INSTALLATION INSTRUCTION:
Take EVERYTHING from the [latest release .zip file](https://github.com/Quad-Plex/quads-modest-toolbox/releases) 
(look for the quads-modest-toolbox-<version>.zip file) and drop it into your modest-menu /scripts folder. 
The structure of the folder should look like this afterwards:

```
‚îúüíæ modest-menu.exe
‚îúüìÅ scripts 
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ quads_toolbox_scripts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìù launcher_quads_toolbox.lua
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìù loops_quads_toolbox.lua
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìù README.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ <other script files>
```

If you want to, you can delete the `README.md` file if you don't need it anymore.
