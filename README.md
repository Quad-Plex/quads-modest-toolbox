Todo:
- Create separate submenu entries for the script categories
- action key for the vehicle jump
- FIX THE PICUPS/MODEL LIST JFC what have I done there
- make the hotkeys customizable and save them to json
- add more settings to playerlist and save to json
  - Think of which settings would make sense
- Perhaps create separate lua files for the looped troll actions to separate their threads
- Add Readme and FAQ description for unclear actions
- More testing with the invisible MOC maybe
- More testing with the speedometer and maye other labels/displayboxtypes for the quick display
